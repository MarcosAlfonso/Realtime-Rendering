Urgent:
	Implement defining grid points with images
		Set vertex height by using sampler in vertex shader? 

	Free up memory! Do it already so you know how!

General:
	Try out GLDebugger or whatever it was called

Mesh:
	Add some sort of general debug rendering, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
