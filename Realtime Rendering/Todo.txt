Urgent:
	Implement defining grid points with images
		Load a height map in main
		Have GridMesh take said height map as an argument
		Make that loaded texture the active texture
		use glGetTexImage to convert image to a 1D array
		Use value of that array in the PopulateVertices function when defining y value


	Free up memory! Do it already so you know how!

General:
	Try out GLDebugger or whatever it was called

Mesh:
	Add some sort of general debug rendering, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
