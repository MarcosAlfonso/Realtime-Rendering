Engine Work:
	Get rotation workings from physics to render
		How can we make it smarter? Should we switch a bunch of glm stuff to the bullet provided stuff?
	Memory Management
	
Cleanup:
	Cleanup includes!!! Quit avoiding this... lol

Physics:
	Object spawning
	Terrain Physics
	Object picking

Terrain:
	Use GLM procedural noise instead of libnoise!!!
	Terrain Physics

Shaders:
	Shader Based Sky, scattering and shiz
	Atmospheric fog
	Add some sort of general debug shader, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class to seperate it from controls.

Future Stuff: 

	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html

Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
	First person parkour puzzle game?
