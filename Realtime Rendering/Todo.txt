Urgent:
	Implement defining grid points with images
	Continue region-ing off sections of code, commenting, cleaning up overall.
	Do all these other To-Do's before you move on to any thing else large.

General:
	Make sure you're deleting everything you need to, hint, you aren't
	More robust debug text system?
	Try out GLDebugger or whatever it was called

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

~Deconstructor:
	Need to check for memory leaks and such, ***a ton of stuff isn't getting freed***

MeshInstance:
	Merge RenderGrid into Render

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
