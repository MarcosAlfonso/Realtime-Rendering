Urgent:

	Terrain can't go above certain vertex count without getting spiderwebby
		

	Free up memory! Do it already so you know how!
	Clean up library linkage and shiz

General:
	Try out GLDebugger or whatever it was called

Mesh:
	Add some sort of general debug rendering, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics

	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
