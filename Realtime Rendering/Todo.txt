Current:
	So you got the first part of the Geometry Shader Tutorial working, you're at "creating a geometry shader"
	Drawing text messes up drawing of 4 red points, and I think it is because the text doesnt have its own VAO or something like that, and 
		it's binding its vertices to the geometry VAO, i dunno. Just thinking outloud here.

General:
	Make sure you're deleting everything you need to, hint, you aren't
	More robust debug text system?

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

~Deconstructor:
	Need to check for memory leaks and such, ***a ton of stuff isn't getting freed***
