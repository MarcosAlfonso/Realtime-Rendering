Urgent:
	Implement defining grid points with images
	Clean up grid related code
	GLuint buffers array in Mesh is potentially going to lead to more confusion than convenience, give each std vector an ID? Or some other solution
	Do all these other To-Do's before you move on to any thing else large, and clean up/comment things over all

General:
	Make sure you're deleting everything you need to, hint, you aren't
	More robust debug text system?
	Try out GLDebugger or whatever it was called

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

~Deconstructor:
	Need to check for memory leaks and such, ***a ton of stuff isn't getting freed***

MeshInstance:
	Merge RenderGrid into Render

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
