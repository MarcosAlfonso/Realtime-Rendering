Urgent:
	Clean up library linkage and shiz

Terrain:
	Make a terrain class, uses array of GridMeshs to render large terrains from perlin noise
	Make further chunks be lower res, early LOD

Mesh:
	Add some sort of general debug rendering, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class? seperate it from controls.

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
