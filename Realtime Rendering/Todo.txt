Urgent:
	Terrain normals appear to not be working, since directional lights work on suzanne, and not terrain

Terrain:
	Make a terrain class, uses array of GridMeshs to render large terrains from perlin noise
	Make further chunks be lower res, early LOD

Controls:
	Object picking! Just link bullet I guess and use that

Debug:
	Memory cleanup for debug utils

Mesh:
	Add some sort of general debug rendering, render out normals, verts, whatevers else

Camera:
	Make a camera class to seperate it from controls.

Maintenance:
	Clean up library linkage and shiz
	Clean up includes

Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
