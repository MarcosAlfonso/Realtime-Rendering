Current:
	Got the grid generator function working (I think) trying to debug it by making terrain shader use geometry shaders to render vertices, but kinda stuck
	nothing is rendering, despite matching open.gl tutorial. 

General:
	Make sure you're deleting everything you need to, hint, you aren't
	More robust debug text system?

Camera:
	Make a camera class, seperate it from controls.

~Deconstructor:
	Need to check for memory leaks and such, ***a ton of stuff isn't getting freed***

MeshInstance:
	Merge RenderGrid into Render

New Stuff:
	Geometry shaders
	Terrain!
	


Future Stuff: 

	Bullet Physics
	Grass: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems/gpugems_ch07.html
	Atmosphere Spread Rendering: http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html
	
Random Ideas:
	Fast moving target shooting, ala Tribes?
